Setup:
The program's .exe file can be found in dist/main.
To use our program, you are given a configuration file in JSON format - config.json.
The Config file has to be kept in the same folder as the EXE file.

Running Instructions:
1. Set up your desired configuration in config.json. All available parameters are listed below the object itself.
   Please avoid using incoherent configurations such as using NQueens fitness function in a string matching problem;
   The application will throw an exception and running it won't be possible.
2. After making sure config.json is present in the same folder as main.exe, double click the main.exe file.
   The program will automatically run according to the configuration you entered.
